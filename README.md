# Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-Mean-Algorithem
We went through the customer segmentation model in this data science project. We created this using unsupervised learning, a type of machine learning.
We used a clustering algorithm called K-means clustering in particular. With the help of clustering.
With the help of clustering, we can understand the variables much better, prompting us to take careful decisions. With the identification of customers, 
companies can release products and services that target customers based on several parameterslike income, age, spending patterns, etc. Furthermore, 
more complex patterns like product reviews are taken into consideration for better segmentation.
